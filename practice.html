					<h1>Theory and Practices</h1>
					<br>
					<h2>Five Statements</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Thou shalt always remember the meaningless of life!</li>
						<li>Thou shalt indulge instead of abstain!</li>
						<li>Thou shalt fool others if it means your benefit!</li>
						<li>Thou shalt relish in chaos and one's pride!</li>
						<li>Thou shalt never forget the will of Cthulhu and the elder gods!</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
					<p>The beliefs we abide by are, simply put, hard to describe. It's questionable, after all, to follow in the footsteps of strange and unknown gods beyond our understanding. But it is what we do, for we are not the ones in control when it comes to the big picture. We can make our small influences, and those can matter, but only in the short term. It's stress-inducing, no doubt, to place your future in your hands. But it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
					<p>What we do is make our lives a playground, and lend our will to the elder gods. Thinking about it, it's difficult to swallow, isn't it? You wouldn't want that, having your will gone. But you see, it already has been. These gods have always been here. They exist in planes we can only just begin to fathom, our eyes unable to even truly see them. Think about the 4th dimension for example: we can simulate it, for certain...but we can't see it. Only imagine it within our limited minds. It's a thought we choose, like everything else, to amuse ourselves with. It's easiest that way, after all.</p>
					<p>The truth is, they can give us that sight, and so much more. We need only submit to them. Cthulhu will show us the way, in time, when he is finally released from his slumber.</p>
					<p>We at the Church conduct rituals to gain his favor, and with those, we may soon find the means to locate his home and gain his eternal wisdom.</p>
					<p class="subtext">You can find out more by visiting our location, or giving us a call! Membership details will be provided then.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Our Symbols</h2>
					<p>These symbols are ones we ask you to make a meaning from. We have none to give; only for you to interpret.</p>
					<p class="tiny">Though seriously don't make a dirty joke from them.</p>
