					<h1>Welcome.</h1>
					<p>It is easy to feel that the lives we carry have meaning in the universe. It's a warm, fuzzy feeling. We often can get to witness that first-hand, as things around us change based off everything we do. When we build something, it's there, right in front of us.</p>
					<p>And yet, there's so much we fail to change. Much that, no matter how hard we try, nothing comes out of it. It can be so painful to hold our grip. Wouldn't it be nice to just let go?</p>
					<p>From the beginnings of the Earth, long ago before we ever walked, the elder god known as Cthulhu fell into a deep sleep within our oceans. A Great Old One, among many others, that once ruled our little planet. The skies, the earth, and the seas were their domain. Since they have fallen, us humans came to be. Though with all our accomplishments, and all we have won, we are merely insects in their gaze.</p>
					<p>Our universe is, in truth, uncaring. Purposeless. No amount of our faux influence changes anything beyond our limited scope. After all, we are little people on a planet that's among millions of others, in a galaxy filled with millions of stars and systems. And the universe, filled with more galaxies than we can fathom. We few recognize this, and who our true masters are.
					<p>It all begins with Cthulhu.</p>
					<p>He awaits in R'lyeh.</p>
					<p>Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!</p>

							<h2>New Church Location Discovered</h2>
							<p>After our last site of worship had unfortunately been dismantled rather thoroughly by local law enforcement, it appears we have managed to discover a new one! In the middle of a decrepit forest, no less, a large abandoned house with a room well suited. It is a glorious day for the Church.<br>(Please contact for further details, including FULL identification.)</p>

						<li>They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over...well, it turns out, we actually mix up our dagger choices. So we're not insane!</li>
						<li>Cthulhu's name cannot be truly pronounced by our limited language, but this is the closest we can get!</li>
						<li>Cthulhu might actually have a parent, and four children, each with possible names we still haven't figured out!</li>
