							<h2>New Church Location Discovered</h2>
							<p>After our last site of worship had unfortunately been dismantled rather thoroughly by local law enforcement, it appears we have managed to discover a new one! In the middle of a decrepit forest, no less, a large abandoned house with a room well suited. It is a glorious day for the Church.<br>(Please contact for further details, including FULL identification.)</p>

Though the hoodies you'll need to get directly from us at our address, unfortunately, so be sure to pack plenty!</p>

							<h2>A Traitor in our Midst</h2>
							<p>It seems an outsider has found our way into our ranks, according to reports by church members. If you ever happen to speak with a person concealing a police officer's badge in their pockets, please not only search them thoroughly, but ask if they've undergone the initiation and if they'd like to be a sacrifice. If they do not eagerly answer yes, please alert a minister.</p>
